# Realer Stage Tweaker
Customizes stage features that [pseudopulse's StageTweaker](https://thunderstore.io/package/pseudopulse/StageTweaker/) does not offer. **This is not a replacement**!! download the other one too for complete stage control.

adds ability to customize the composition and weight of enemies and interactables per stage.

commissioned by @DaltonGoesFast @ discord

## !! Note
* after you configure the stage, enemies won't be disabled if you disable the enemy in the lobby menu via "turning off" the dlc. [ContentDisabler](https://thunderstore.io/package/William758/ContentDisabler/) should still work.
* SS2's shock drone cannot be configurated here due to MSU weirdness, configurate them on their configs (if it exists).

## Changelog
* 1.0.3: fixed various legacy monster pool issue
* 1.0.2: made the crash more lenient (even if some details have changed it will load with stuff missing), moon family fix
* 1.0.1: readme
